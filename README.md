This repository is no longer maintained, nor do I recommend to try and fix it since both the explicit dependencies (Ruby gems) and implicit ones (yad2's abominated use of DOM) have changed.

Keeping the rpository here because I do plan to re-write it when I get the time to do so, if no one else procedes me (I'd very much welcome you to do so!).
